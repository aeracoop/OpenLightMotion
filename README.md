## Light
We use infrared light, invisible to humans, to track high speed drones.

## Motion
With two Pixy smart cameras we capture motion and send the information to a ground station.

## Authors and Contributors
This project is developped by @lotelx, @nerochiaro and some collaborators.
This software is based on previous works like VRTraker.xyz, and the IR-Lock precision landing system.
